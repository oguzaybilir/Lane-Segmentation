# Segmentation Ä°nferences Tool for U-Net and YOLOv7

This project was conducted to compare the two most widely used segmentation architectures in real time.

The system features:

    OS : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 64-bit 
    CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10200H CPU @ 2.40GHz
    GPU : Nvidia GTX 1650ti 4GB
    RAM : Samsung M471A1K43DB1-CWE 16GB

## Inferences on Photo and Video

## Cloning the Repository

Install this repository with git.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/oguzaybilir/Lane-Segmentation.git
  cd Lane-Segmentation
```

## Requiring Libraries and Packages

There is a requirements.txt file to install packages you need. This file contains almost all libraries and modules used in the project.

To install this libraries and packages:

```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run 
The project is so easy to use.
```bash
  python3 main.py --weights "path to your YOLOv7 weights" --source "path to your photo or video"
  python3 main.py --weights "path to your U-Net weights" --source "path to your photo or video"
```
This repository is only accepts .mp4, .jpg, .png, .pt, .h5 and .hdf5 files.

## Special Thanks and Regards

I manipulated @RizwanMunawar's ![https://github.com/RizwanMunawar/yolov7-segmentation] repository a little bit for my usage. So I owe a thank you to @RizwanMunawar

I also owe a debt of gratitude to my mentor @MehmetOKUYAR. He guided me in my journey in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing.
